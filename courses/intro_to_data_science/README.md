![FAAST logo](/images/FAAST_preto.png)

Welcome to the Git repository for the "FAAST Advance Data Science - Intro to Data Science" learning path ðŸŽ‰

This course is designed to cover the data science concepts you'll need to start with your data science journey.

The course is extracted from the Lisbon Data Science Academy. It covers the following topics:

- Data Wrangling and Manipulation
- Descriptive Statistics
- Regression
- Decision Trees
- K-means Clustering
- Support Vector Machines

In this introduction, you'll learn:

- The principles driving your learning experience in this course.
- The structure of the course.
- How to setup your development environment.
- The expectations for students and mentors.

## Learning Principles

When we assembled this course, we had in mind that our students would be adult individuals with time constraints. They will be looking to implement the knowledge in their work environment and maybe discuss it with their peers.

To fulfill these expectations, we adopted the following principles:

- Prefer self-directed learning over teacher-directed learning;
- Prefer content that's easily accessible (no paywalls or subscriptions);
- Prefer content that can be immediately applied;
- Always use code examples;
- Learning by teaching is encouraged.

> **Note**: You'll find some folders with the `HCKTxx` prefix. These are the folders used on Hackathons at the Lisbon Data Science Academy.

### Extra content

These are optional content that, despite not being required, are great next steps in your Data Science journey.

- [BLU01 - Messy Data](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students/tree/main/S02%20-%20Data%20Wrangling/BLU01%20-%20Messy%20Data): This is a bonus learning unit that teaches you how to handle alternative structured data files such as csv files (with specific delimiters or corrupt data) and non-csv formats (like excel with multiple sheets or json files). It also covers handling larger datasets.
- [BLU02 - Advanced Wrangling](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students/tree/main/S02%20-%20Data%20Wrangling/BLU02%20-%20Advanced%20Wrangling): This bonus leaning unit cover how to combine multiple datasets to create your working dataset. It also covers scikit-learn's `Pipeline` and `TransformerMixin` classes, which are very useful when you want to create a pipeline that combines multiple steps.
- [BLU03 - Data Extraction from Different Sources](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students/tree/main/S02%20-%20Data%20Wrangling/BLU03%20-%20Data%20Sources): In this third and final bonus unit, you'll learn how to extract information from SQL tables and the Web.

Students are to be given a mentor who will guide them through the course and provide feedback on their progress.

**Mentors**: A mentor is a more experienced collaborator and/or chapter leads. They should be able to assess the skill level of their students and know what they need to learn to perform well at their projects.
r
They are in charge of helping their mentees, answering questions and preventing them from being stuck, as well as keeping track of their progress.

## Learning Structure

### Progress and Questions Tracking

In order to help mentors in tracking the progress of their mentees, we suggest using the following template:

- [Progress Question Tracking template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nODnLBLCcC6Dqe_pK_bog-BA78E9AuUq1l4S81Px61w/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Tracking questions

Tracking questions is important so that we can improve the quality of the selected material, as well as create new ones.

We understand that some chapters might be really close, and students might want to ask questions directly to the mentor, to also have the question available publicly is to everybody's advantage.

### Initial Setup

Students should [these instructions](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students/blob/main/README.md) in order to setup their development environment.

### Learning Unit Workflow

The Lisbon Data Science Academy has already implemented a workflow for students to complete their learning units. You can find it [here](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch5-students#learning-unit-workflow). However, since NOS is not affiliated with the LDSSA, exercises are not to be graded; what matters is that your code tests all pass.

> **Warning** The exercises are not to be graded. The LDSSA expects their students to push their code to their GitHub repo to be graded on their Portal.
>
> This is a limitation on our side, so please ignore grading instructions, which involve pushing code to their repo and logging in to their Portal.

Some of the academy's presentations may not be available to the public. So we collected them all and added to the `resources` folder. Be sure to check them out as you go through the learning units!

## Expectations

### Expectations for students

Although we understand that time may be constrained, each student has responsibilities with their mentors, namely:

- Be open in your discussions with the mentor.
- Be courteous and respectful  to your peers and mentor.
- Set your progress expectations with your mentor.
- Conduct yourself with integrity and honesty.

### Expectations for mentors

A mentor are tasked in ensuring their peers become better professionals, as such, we expect them to:

- Reserve at least 30 minutes per week for the people you mentor, for answering questions and giving feedback.
- Encourage your mentee to communicate openly with you.
- Be courteous and respectful to your mentees.
- Keep track of questions and progress of the mentees (see [Progress tracking](#progress-and-questions-tracking))
- Conduct yourself with integrity and honesty.

## Pre-requisites

In order to make the best use of this learning path, you should know:

- Basic / Intermediary Python: control flow, functions, handling errors, data structures, files, virtual environments, data manipulation libraries.
- Basic Git: add, commit, checkout, merge, and rebase
